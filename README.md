XPDisplay
=========

XPDisplay for XPlane.  See http://www.duncanjauncey.com/xplane/xpdisplay/

The build.xml file is leftover from when this project was built in Netbeans.  You'll probably have more success if you set it up from scratch in your favourite IDE (IntelliJ, of course!).

The code in this project is Copyright (c) 2013 Duncan Jauncey, but you are free to use it for non-commercial use, and to make your own version & (suggested, but not required) contribute patches/pull requests back.

Thank you!
